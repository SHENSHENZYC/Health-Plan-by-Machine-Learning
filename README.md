# Health Plan by Machine Learning

Leading Nutrition and Healthy Choice

This project aims to implement machine learning techniques to help people manage their health by giving out an appropriate meal plan. We mainly solve two questions: 
how to select food sensibly to supplement the nutrition we need, and how to match food to improve the quality of our diet.

The files ABBREV27.xlsx and nndbflat.csv consist of the data set this project is primarily based on. They are obtained from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
National Nutrient Database. 

The ipynb file presents the code where machine learning techniques are implemented for nutrition analysis. Use local jupyter notebook environment or online environment like 
Google Colaboratory for access. 

The pdf file serves as a summary of this project which includes motive of this project, description of data, methods and results, and discussion of the results. Check out this
